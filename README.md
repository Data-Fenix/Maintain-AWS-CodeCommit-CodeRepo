## Demo -How to maintain AWS CodeCommit repository? 

## What is code repository?
A code repository is a place to store codes, documents, notes, scripts and other items related to your project. In other words, we can say code storage. Usually, code repositories are handled by VCS  (Version  Control  System)  softwares  such  as  git.  If  you  need  to  success  your  software development project, you must maintain a good code repository.


## Benefits of having a code repository

1. <b>High security</b>
<p>Repositories facilitate a good security for our codes. If something happens to the main version of the code, we can revert the changes or retrieve the older version of the code. And also, some repository providers automatically encrypt our repo’s files and allow us to customize user specific access to our repository. (ex: AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM))</p>
2. <b>Always have a backup</b>
<p>Let’s say you store your all the codes inside your local computer. Accidentally your laptop has been attacked by a malware and your files were removed by that virus. Then our files are gone forever. But if you store your all the codes inside a code repository you will always have a backup.</p>
3. <b>Collaboration</b>
<p>Code repositories help you to collaborate on code with numerous other developers or teammates on your company via commiting, pulling requests, branching and merging. They can easily review your code and give feedbacks. And also they can easily control project remotely. </p>
4. <b>Version controlling</b>
<p>It is easy to maintain and keep track of the latest and different versions of the scripts. It also offers simplified  debugging  option  using  side-by-side  comparison,  which  highlights  the  difference between two versions. </p> 
5. <b>Proper documentation</b>
<p>By using readme file of any repository, you can easily organize your project properly. You can add table of contents, demos, screenshots, guidelines, etc. </p>
6. <b>Showcase your talent</b>
<p>Code repositories are great digital portfolios or resumes. Are you looking for a new job or do you need to show your work experience? Code repository is the best way to do that. You can build an attractive profile including all the projects you have done so far and include that repository link into your cv as well as evidence or to show your skills. </p>
7. <b>Faster development lifecycle</b>
<p>You can push incremental changes instead of the entire project. This allows you to reduce time and increase the speed and frequency of your software development lifecycle.</p>

## Why AWS CodeCommit?

<p>There  are  many  code  repository providers  in the  marketplace  and among  them Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket and AWS CodeCommit are the leading service providers in the industry. In  this  article  we  will  talk  about  the  breif  introduction  and  the  capabilities  of  AWS CodeCommit</p>

## Guideline - How to Maintain AWS CodeCommit Repository
In this article we will talk about the [General Guideline for Maintain AWS CodeCommit Repository](https://github.com/Data-Fenix/maintain-aws-codecommit-repository/blob/main/Introduction%20of%20Code%20Repository.docx).

## Limitations
* Do not support <b>.ipynb(IPython notebooks)</b>. Therefore we have to save Python files as <b>.py</b> format.
